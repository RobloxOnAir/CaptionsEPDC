00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alrighty todays daily challenge

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,070
The Financier Stealth

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,670
Hidden UI
Unintimidating

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,160
and No Lockpicks

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,360
So we've got a drill again
with precision drilling

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,560
but once again we got unintimidating

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,100
and hidden UI.

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,590
Hidden UI is not that bad
unintimidating is really the worst
part

9
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,100
because that means
we are gonna actually have to

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,080
hack the computer for this

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,660
Yup
And also I am pretty sure I've lured

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
that camera so we're just gonna bag this body

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
and get right out of there
because I was not careful

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,760
going up here

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,870
and we won't even know because its hidden UI.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,380
That is not a good way of doing it

17
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,060
Lets just run down there
since no one is going to show up

18
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,520
over there
probably

19
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,670
You know what yeah we should 
probably just back off

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,770
grab the disguise over here and
not worry about it

21
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,910
Cyber did you also just

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,730
Right then that's another guard taken
care of I suppose

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,940
which I mean sure

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Now all we got to do i—

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,690
This is too good,
this is literally too good

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,370
You turn yourself in that direction

27
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,400
Alright

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,830
Never mind

29
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,030
We'll just loop the camera regardless

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,940
I mean otherwise we
would have just taken out that guard

31
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,760
we'll rewire this power box and then
afterwards

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,710
we'll deal with the remaining
power boxes

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,280
and
probably also the guard at this rate

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
So that's exactly what we're
going to do

35
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,890
we will completely ignore this guard because

36
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,730
that is absolutely not helpful to us

37
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,270
and you know what we'll seize the
opportunity and knock that guard out in
the perfect location

38
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,710
Cyber's got the last power box
actually which means that what I'm gonna do

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,060
is I'm going to go up here run
past that camera for absolutely no
reason

40
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,260
or actually a very good reason which is
to—

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,590
not getting caught by those two

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,600
I mean that's literally the worst
combination to be caught by but regardless

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,340
we get this door completely open

44
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,750
Cyber should probably loop that camera at some point

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,009
because it's going to help us out
a lot

46
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,810
and actually because I'm about to
open this door

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,370
So

48
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,950
You know what

49
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,440
We'll loop it it's fine
we'll go backwards we'll go past this
and we loop that camera

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
and it's gonna go just fine

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,180
we've got a guard there
but we don't have to worry about it

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,960
the guard is not going to care

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,260
I mean the guard would see the open
doorway

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,850
except for one small caveat

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,900
the door is blocking the guard from
seeing the open doorway

56
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
and therefore
detecting the broken door

57
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,060
which is certainly not a way
I mean it's

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,200
it's certainly a good way of not getting
caught

59
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,330
and I'm not going to complain about it

60
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,530
so we'll go past all of that and we will—

61
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,590
right then we'll go back through here

62
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,150
and we will hope
we will hope that there are no guards

63
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,740
over here to mess with us

64
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,940
we'll start with this photograph of
course

65
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,420
and it seems to be going well

66
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,620
and now all we got to do is not get caught by

67
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,030
Ryan or any of the remaining guards over there

68
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,410
which

69
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,400
is harder than it seems because
that's exactly what's happening right now.

70
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,450
So instead

71
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,350
Why Ryan

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,340
no you're not doing that all right

73
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,110
Just to make it clear

74
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,890
Never mind you are doing that

75
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
There's not much I can do about it so

76
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
we'll go back over here and we will 

77
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,990
this is actually perfect I
mean— All right

78
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,120
We're going to go past all of this, it's
going to be okay

79
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,790
and we're going to get
the safe location

80
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,020
and we'll take advantage of it to open up the safe

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,030
so once the photographs remove we'll
open up the safe

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
grab the hard drive

83
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,670
and now all we got to do is find Ryan

84
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,870
which won't be—

85
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,200
Really?

86
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,590
Which wont be difficult at all

87
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,510
absolutely worth it I mean that guard
almost

88
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,420
got lured

89
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,780
but we should be fine

90
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Now really all we got to do right now is do this

91
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,190
The safe door is being a major
nuisance over here

92
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,670
but I think I I'm still
able to do it so Ryan look at me over here

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Do me a favor and walk over here

94
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
and just in time 

95
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,840
Right then we are grabbing this bag

96
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
and we are getting right out of here

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I mean it's probably a good idea
regardless

98
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,260
So that's exactly what we're
going to do we're going to leave this area

99
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,630
and Cyber the doors open over here
you might just want to leave through that

100
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,090
And that's the daily challenge in
just under 5 minutes

101
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,220
I mean that ending wasn't
exactly too plan

102
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,810
but it worked so I'm
not going to complain about that

103
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,400
Cheers everyone,
 have a great time.

104
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,660
