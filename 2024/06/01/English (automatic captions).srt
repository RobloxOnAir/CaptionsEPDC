1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
all righty today the challenge the

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,720
financial stealth hidden UI

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,440
unintimidating and no lockpicks so we've

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,559
got a drill again with Precision

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,000
Drilling but once again we've got

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,519
unintimidating and hidden UI hdden UI is

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,920
not that bad unintimidating is really

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,920
the worst part because that means we're

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,320
going to actually have to hack a

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,640
computer for this yep and also I'm

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,279
pretty sure I've L that camera so we're

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,080
going to back this body and get right

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,480
out of there because I was not careful

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,079
going up here and we won't even know

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
because it's hidden UI that is not a

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,520
good way of doing it let's just run down

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,520
there since no one's going to show up

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,320
over there

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,320
probably you know what yeah we should

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,520
probably just back off grab the disguise

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,520
over here and then not worry about

22
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,680
it cyber did you also

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,960
adj right then that's not a god taken

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,320
care of I suppose

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,079
which I mean sure

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,040
now all we got to do

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,360
it this is too good this is literally

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,360
too

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,520
good you turn yourself in that direction

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,960
right never mind we'll just leave the

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,720
camera regardless I mean otherwise we

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,680
would have just taken all that guard

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,040
we'll rewire this power box and then

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,960
afterwards we'll deal with the remaining

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,320
power boxes and probably also the god at

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
this rate so that's exactly what we're

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,399
going to do

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,600
we will completely ignore this C because

39
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,119
that is absolutely not helpful to us and

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,320
you know what we'll seize the

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,920
opportunity and knock that guard out in

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,920
the perfect

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,840
location cyber's got a l power box

44
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,280
actually which means that what I'm going

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,880
to do is I'm going to go up here run

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,600
past that camera for absolutely no

47
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,360
reason or actually a very good reason

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,680
which is

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,680
to not getting caught by those two I

50
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,200
mean that's literally the worst

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,960
combination to be caught by regardless

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,840
we get this door completely open cyber

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,479
should probably loot that camera at some

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,039
point because it's going to help us out

55
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,479
a lot and actually because I'm about to

56
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,479
open this

57
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,879
door

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,319
so you know what we'll Loop it it's fine

59
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,120
we'll go backwards we'll go past this

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,040
and we Loop that camera and it's going

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,440
to go just fine we've got a god there

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,000
but we don't have to worry about it the

63
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,519
guard's not going to care I

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,519
mean the guard would see the open

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:45,080
doorway except for one small

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,560
caveat the door is blocking the god from

67
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,080
seeing the open doorway and therefore

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,159
detecting the broken

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,080
door which is certainly not a way I mean

70
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,360
it's certainly a good way of not getting

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
caught and I'm not going to complain

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
about it so we'll go past all of that

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
and we will

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,400
right then we'll go back through here

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,040
and we will

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,120
hope we will hope that there are no Gods

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,319
over here to mess with us we'll start

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,280
with this photograph of

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,680
course and it seems to be going well and

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,080
now all we got to do is not get caught

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,799
by Ryan or any of the remaining Gods

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,799
over there

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,959
which it's harder than it seems because

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,080
that's exactly what's happening right

85
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,080
now so

86
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,599
instead why

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,480
Ryan no you're not doing that all right

88
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,120
just to make it

89
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,200
clear never mind you are doing that

90
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,879
there's not much I can do about it so

91
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,400
we'll go back over here and we will this

92
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,799
is actually perfect I

93
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,799
mean all right

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,400
we're going to go past all of this it's

95
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,599
going to be okay and we're going to get

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,720
the safe location and we'll take

97
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,319
advantage of it to open up the

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,959
safe so once the photographs remov we'll

99
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,680
open up the safe grab the hard drive and

100
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,560
now all we got to do is find Ryan

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,919
which won't be really which won't be

102
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,919
difficult at

103
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,280
all absolutely worth it I mean that got

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,080
almost

105
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,039
got Le but we should be fine now really

106
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,479
all we got to do right now is do

107
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,039
this the safe door is being a major

108
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,199
Nuance over here but I think I I'm still

109
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,280
able to do it so Ryan look at me over

110
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,919
here do me a favor and walk over here

111
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,919
and just in

112
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,000
time right then we are grabbing this bag

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,240
and we are getting right out of here I

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,280
mean it's probably a good idea

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,800
regardless so that's exactly what we're

116
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,919
going to do we're going to leave this

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,160
area and cyber the doors open over here

118
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,880
you might just want to leave through

119
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,400
that and that's the daily challenge in

120
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,639
just under 5

121
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,680
minutes I mean that ending wasn't

122
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,440
exactly too plann but it worked so I'm

123
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,610
not going to complain about that cheers

124
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:29,840
everyone have a great time

125
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:32,080
[Music]

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:40,060
oh
