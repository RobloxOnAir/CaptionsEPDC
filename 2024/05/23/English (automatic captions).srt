1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
all right today's C challenge the

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,200
scientist stealth no suppressors setting

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,000
UI and fast detection so you've got no

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,880
suppressors which means that will

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
literally going to have to knock every

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,799
single person out

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
instead and it also means that we're

8
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,240
going to have to find the second command

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,160
which might not be exactly the best

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,520
thing ever now aside from that we've got

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,640
hidden UI and FAS detection which is

12
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,519
like balancing

13
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,960
detection except that is far more

14
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,240
stressful now cyber if you could do me a

15
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,000
favor and not get caught over that that

16
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,119
would be

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,679
fantastic I mean that's convenient we

18
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,079
know who the second command is now so

19
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,920
so C I'm not going to go inside it's

20
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,559
fast detection right now all right and

21
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,079
that guard is going to detect me real

22
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,480
fast

23
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,559
so we're just going to wait here and

24
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,800
then we're going to have to realize that

25
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,440
is fast protection so we can't actually

26
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,320
lure anyone so hopefully you walk

27
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,960
towards us right now which is not

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,760
happening so we'll just make a cyber

29
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,280
problem we'll run past all of that and

30
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,399
we will hope that that guard does not

31
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,280
show up over here because if that

32
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,160
happens we're not going to be having a

33
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,199
good time

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,519
so we'll open up this door the guard

35
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,760
is did that guard go into the shed of

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,400
all places you know what let's not

37
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,200
question it we'll open up we'll take

38
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,320
this opportunity to open up this door we

39
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,640
will run as far away as

40
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,000
possible and the guards staying there

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,200
all right in that case hi there Falcon

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,479
nice to meet

43
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,840
you just don't be on radio all right I

44
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,320
mean we've got a screwdriver we'll

45
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,040
eventually need that so we might as well

46
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,520
grab that now all we got to do is make

47
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
our way back over there

48
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,600
and then afterwards not get attacked

49
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,560
this time which is far more stressful

50
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
than

51
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,119
it we'll just get this door open we'll

52
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,560
go inside and then afterwards cyber will

53
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,079
hopefully deal with the second command

54
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,159
and a decent amount of time

55
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,920
which that is not the second command hi

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,399
there I'm going to slide right past you

57
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,600
and then cyber is just a

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,280
guard which one is

59
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,759
it all right I'll grabb that key card

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,479
you don't get caught and then

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,000
afterwards actually I'm going to back

62
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,759
off to just so that cyber has an easier

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,800
time moving that back without getting

64
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:17,800
the tech bring it this way

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,840
don't why would you know what never mind

66
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,319
we'll take this risky time to go inside

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,319
which I mean it's not that bad but it

68
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,040
isn't great either hi that Guard we're

69
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,040
just going to walk right past you and

70
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,599
then afterwards we use the key card

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,840
reader and now all we got to do is wait

72
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,160
cyber you know you can come down here

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
right and help me deal with the

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,959
guard all right I suppose I'm doing this

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,360
myself then so in that case we'll wait

76
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,440
for this to complete which it should be

77
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,800
done soon hello

78
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,879
there and there we go that's that taken

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,560
care of and now all we got to do is use

80
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,319
that screwdriver we have to avoid these

81
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,360
guards actually first of all hi there

82
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,920
folks the control room doors on the

83
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,239
other side of course it is in that case

84
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,879
we'll go through here then

85
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,959
there are hi there there are a lot of

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,360
options over there and of course right

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,720
Falcons over there which means that we

88
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,959
can't actually do anything right now so

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,319
fcon if you can move right now that

90
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,319
would be

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,000
fantastic this is awkward there we go

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,360
and I watch as this gu turns my way and

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,840
then starts detecting me

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,200
which I'm actually very happy that it

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,040
there we go I mean at least it was timed

96
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,159
well so that shouldn't cause us too many

97
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,159
problems and then once Rivera gives the

98
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,920
information we can get this rewired

99
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,519
without getting caught because

100
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,080
everything went just fine after Falcon

101
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,280
left which it did not go just fine after

102
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,920
the Falcon left that guard is still

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,680
detecting me right now and I not feeling

104
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,360
comfortable about it all right we could

105
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,879
technically slide past both of these

106
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,760
guards and not get

107
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,760
seriously of course you know what our

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,840
priority should first of all not get

109
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,040
detected by Falcon but also not get

110
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,079
detected by any guardi in general so I

111
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,760
suppose of course we're going to go down

112
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,120
we're going to not get caught and then

113
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,840
we're just going to wait

114
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,200
here we're just going to you're still

115
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,799
there you are over here now walk past

116
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,320
right just move past me don't cause us

117
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,880
any problems and presumably there we go

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,040
now I can finally get the electrical

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,240
panel rewired and go inside

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,560
which surely this won't go horribly

121
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,560
wrong right

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,800
and that's everyone clear which this

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,360
door is precarious I should bag those

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,440
bodies up we will not do that though

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,080
because we can and then afterwards all

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,400
we got to do is manage taking people out

127
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,320
which how hard could that possibly be we

128
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,440
will start with Falcon and we will

129
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,680
remember that actually we should

130
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,320
probably bag up Falcon first just in

131
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,039
case anyone walks here and I'm realizing

132
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,960
that I actually don't have any solutions

133
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,639
for entering one of these there's a

134
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,840
guard over there I think I was being

135
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
hidden by that column or whatever that

136
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,560
is but we're just going to go in here

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,199
and take advantage of this time we have

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,639
and of course the W Cutters are here not

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,160
that we really need it but regardless

140
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,960
we're going to grab the USB mainly

141
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,400
because we can and now all we got to do

142
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,639
is clear the remaining Gods which can't

143
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,759
really happen if you're over here I mean

144
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,560
it's technically clear over there right

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,680
we could do this this is a bad idea so

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,880
we're just going to wait hold on it's

147
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,120
also like clear right now you know what

148
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
in that case let's try something

149
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,520
this is a very bad this is very bad

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,919
timing right

151
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,280
now that was not supposed to happen

152
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,560
we'll go down here I think cyber's going

153
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,039
to take that guard out and then

154
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,479
afterwards we're going to clear the

155
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,720
remaining guard Falcon ready out so that

156
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,880
means that we should be clearing the

157
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,919
entire map actually so we can do that

158
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,360
without any problems and all we got to

159
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:02,160
do is wait for Sparrow which hold on

160
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,039
let's do that and let's do that there we

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,319
go now Sparrow get us out of here before

162
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:13,690
cyber keeps that's just under 6 minutes

163
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:33,100
cheers everyone have a great time

164
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:33,100
