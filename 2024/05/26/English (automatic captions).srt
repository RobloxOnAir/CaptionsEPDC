1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,520
all righty today's city challenge to set

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,279
up St fre andfor stores unintimidating

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,279
and take down

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,360
limit this sounds

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,960
fun take down limit and

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,560
unintimidating which means I'm going to

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
have to just knock people out including

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,279
the camera

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
operator and we can't even take everyone

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,599
out in this

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,960
case s that was incredibly ambitious and

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,519
also there is no it's actually perfect

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,880
I'll knock this guard out and I keep it

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,000
and then afterwards we'll go figure out

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,600
what's happening so cyber's going to

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,920
actually lockpick that open and disable

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,079
the window alarms because that's kind of

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,480
how this works and then afterwards we'll

19
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,239
go upstairs but actually we'll start by

20
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,079
avoiding that

21
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,600
camera that's not how sure that works I

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,239
mean I'm not going to complain about it

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,000
but it's definitely questionable to some

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
extent so now we're going to do is wait

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,600
cyber and that got to leave no we're not

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,440
doing that

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,839
guard if you could there we go and all

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,159
I'm got to do is lock why am I lock

30
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,560
picking this

31
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,799
one there there is

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,280
literally all right we'll lockpick this

33
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,560
one too why not right that g might

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,920
actually cause us some Pro right then

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
we're not doing that I'm just going to

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
go down here and I'm going to go past

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,680
all of this and I'm going to go over

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
here and see if it's a camera

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,880
operator it is not the camera operator

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
this is the safe room that is not that

41
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,399
useful right then

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,720
maybe don't check this first since this

43
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,479
is the way I'm doing it is rather dumb

44
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,240
too and of course there a guard here at

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,960
just the perfect time right then we're

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,000
checking upstairs

47
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,719
first I mean I probably could

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,680
have you're joking and also cyber why do

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,200
you have a guard with a radio over there

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,880
you're supposed to wait you know what

51
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,600
it's fine we'll go back down and shy

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,600
this we're going back up

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,159
all right we'll wait for this one go

54
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:14,040
on there we go and we

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,040
will

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,800
right you'll be fine this is the server

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,280
room we are going downstairs

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,280
okay let's go over here and then

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,480
afterwards we're going through this door

60
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,040
and then afterwards we

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480
will yeah it's not going to work

62
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,480
hack the cameras and afterwards we'll

63
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,200
grab the key card and then hopefully we

64
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,160
don't walk into a bunch of God when we

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,800
leave this

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,000
room almost did right then now all we

67
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,840
got to do is figure out what we're doing

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,319
with literally everything here so we'll

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,080
start by searching these fouls and

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,319
hopefully it goes

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,959
well

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,959
hopefully it probably

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,480
won't it's not of course it's not why

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
would it be those far specifically on

75
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,840
the first

76
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,920
sorry I'm going to do something really

77
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,920
dumb and it's going to

78
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,480
work all right unless us don't walk

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,840
downstairs right right we're we're done

80
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,280
I made that God stop this isn't this is

81
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,879
not even funny anymore don't walk

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,879
towards me good walk no absolutely

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,400
not I'm GNA play a game right I'm going

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,040
to walk and I'm going to finish that

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,879
and it's not it that was literally not

86
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,599
worth it at all it it literally was not

87
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,360
worth it at

88
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,680
all right then we'll open up this door I

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,000
literally have a key card why am I

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,360
scrambling it well cyber is going to

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,400
find a last fou

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,760
right right right then we're going

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,680
downstairs again to find the last foul

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,879
is it

95
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:02,079
over good one cyber great one

96
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,480
right then

97
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,840
let's actually this is perfect you look

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,879
over here right don't pay too much

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,760
attention and I will search these fows

100
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,560
and you will not cause me any problems

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,519
right okay okay no you keep staring in

102
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,799
this direction don't cause me any more

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,240
problems and I will finally finish

104
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,810
searching these

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,919
FS don't

106
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,680
[Music]

107
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,080
you know that was risky but I'm happy

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,280
that it worked I'm going to go search

109
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,520
the servers so we're not going to have

110
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,560
any more of these problems and we're

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
actually going to use the key card so

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,240
that that gu does not attack me now

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,320
right then we'll set up this connection

114
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,880
and then afterwards we're going to go

115
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,120
open the

116
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,360
safe and cyber's going to go plant The

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,520
Trackers over

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,759
there right then let's go

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,120
down and at this rate cyber's going to

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,039
be upstairs faster than I can be

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,639
downstairs so we'll run through all of

122
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,280
this maybe not the best idea but it'll

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,280
be fine and will open up this

124
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,120
save and I assume cyber's going to join

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,120
us recently

126
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,120
soon

127
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,000
right right

128
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,560
then we'll grab this cash and we'll get

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,919
out of

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,840
here where is

131
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,199
cyber you know what it's fine camera

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
operator ST which means door alarms

133
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,639
won't cause us any problems which means

134
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,280
I can just run out of there through the

135
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,560
front door and that's the da CH in just

136
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,960
under 5 minutes and 15 seconds I mean

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,319
unintimidating and take down limit is a

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,400
definitely intimidating combination but

139
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,520
it's not exactly horrible either just a

140
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,970
small change of tactics cheers everyone

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:06:02,300
have a great time

142
00:05:42,970 --> 00:06:02,300
