1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
all righty today C challenge black side

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,599
stealth no Scrambler bloodless and 15

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,599
minutes so it's

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,799
bloodless that's fine aside from that

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,679
we've got no Scrambler which means you

6
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,000
have to clear the entire ST which

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
shouldn't be too bad either but aside

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,519
from that we've got 15 minutes

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,199
which I mean we've got a lot more stuff

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,000
to do now so we should be able to do it

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,359
decently fast but if

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,120
we cyber I assume you're looping that

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,800
right then we'll loot this

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,680
camera and then afterwards I assume we

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,600
can actually just yeah we can put your

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,280
hands up absolutely nothing we'll back

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,640
them up and hopefully no one walks right

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,719
over here right now because that will be

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,079
really really

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,000
awkward so we'll grab a this guys

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,600
cyber's going to stand on top of the

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,039
container for absolutely no reason and

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
we'll leave this back in the container

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,559
and then now we got to find another two

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,800
Gods which there's one over there and

26
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:06,519
there's one over

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,519
there right then once that one

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,080
leaves you should

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,479
probably when is that you know what we

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,479
can go up here we can loot this camera

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,880
first proba we wait for that to happen I

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,079
mean might as well

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,360
right all right that guard's far enough

34
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,200
away we'll just knock you out over here

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,479
and we got a key card so that's actually

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,040
fantastic so we'll grab cyber disguise

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,040
and then afterwards we'll get right to

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,200
this or at least get right to actually

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,159
entering restrict the area cyber you

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
should probably go back up there I've

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,000
literally got a disguise for you it's

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,880
not that

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
complicated and I suppose you could

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,000
leave that guard

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,719
alone really just leave him alone it's

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,159
not that difficult and now we'll run

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,960
right by loot this

48
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:56,119
camera right then loot this camera why

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,039
are you there just go somewhere else you

50
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,560
know maybe slightly further away that

51
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,920
that would be nice

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,159
just saying I kind of can't put a gun

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,520
out right now

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,840
so cyber actually there is no camera

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,720
here you can just loot

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,959
that all right

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,280
then that guard's moving I'm taking this

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,120
opportunity I'm taking this

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,720
opportunity get down all of you and

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
cyber how did you get a radio over

61
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,599
there you know I'm slightly concerned

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,800
that all right cyber should be fine F

63
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,080
we'll back up the bodies over here and

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,239
we're going to hide them and we're going

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,000
to get right to the restricted area I

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,920
mean

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,519
in a significantly low amount of time

68
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,360
too which is really nice we're into the

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,840
restrict area in just over 2 minutes and

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
30 seconds so back this side we'll hide

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,640
this body and then afterwards we'll move

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,080
right in that door's open perfect C's

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,080
going to be able to get in here and now

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
all we got to do is it's turn not all

75
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,840
right there are two Gods walking down

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
the corridor that's for sure

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:11,000
why you put your hands up anyone else

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,440
perfect now that

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,680
was definitely not enjoyable but cybus

80
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,840
just answer two radios hopefully this

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,680
goes well I'm going to take that gun and

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,400
then afterwards we're going to knock out

83
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,000
this

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,519
guard so now we got to do now is B up

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,959
this body and leave that up over here

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,000
along with the gun because we're not

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
carrying an unpress i7 around for

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,959
absolutely no

89
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,280
reason I mean there is a you're walking

90
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,760
back over

91
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,959
here go on move

92
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,959
past or just stand

93
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,760
there I don't think there's a camera

94
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,599
over there so you know what we're going

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,879
to

96
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,680
do we're going to bag you up and then

97
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,680
we'll just rush it and it's going

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,519
to right then this is going to go really

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,400
there's a was that a camera or was that

100
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,640
a guard

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
all right that was most definitely a

102
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,000
camera then Cy's going to lock pick over

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,439
here and then afterward will move right

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,760
in drop that bag and then move to

105
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,599
restricted area or actually the cell

106
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,840
block we finish the restricted

107
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,400
area so all we got to do now is clear a

108
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,560
few guards and C you need to do me a

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,560
favor and not get caught

110
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,160
which right then in that case you go

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:35,400
up just go in it's not that complicated

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,120
cyber really it really is

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,039
them looping Camas that situation though

114
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,800
really anyways we'll get in here and

115
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:47,639
cyber is opening c

116
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,840
c of course anyways let's see if it's

117
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,840
actually

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,240
CC it is literally actually CC we'll go

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,120
meet Rose then and then afterwards we'll

120
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,320
move right on to the commander area to

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,039
intergate Commander to actually get rose

122
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,680
out of here I mean that's kind of how

123
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,039
this

124
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,160
works no s I refuse to open CI on my own

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,039
I should not let you do that next time

126
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,520
anyways Rose is going to take an

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,960
incredibly long more time to walk all

128
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,960
the way up

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,440
here it's just

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,680
waiting it's literally just waiting get

131
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,080
in there let's go

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,400
I technically have the slightly faster

133
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,639
route compar to cyber so run right past

134
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,840
here open up this door and then start

135
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,280
running up and then afterwards we'll go

136
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,080
to the commander area I

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,840
mean it's just a there we go get that

138
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,560
open move right in and that is not a

139
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,880
commander anyone that's actually the

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,520
commander no there it

141
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,440
is why are you going there of all places

142
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,080
there really right then we can try

143
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,080
something you look at

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:13,280
me perfect actually no

145
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,280
look hold on you look at

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,360
me and now

147
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,319
you walk all the way over here and now

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,039
cyber because you're out of radios I'm

149
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,800
going to answer this one

150
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,319
put your hands up get down un oner the

151
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,599
radio and cyber's going to interrogate a

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,240
commander afterwards and I'm going to

153
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,840
try and find what a terminal is because

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,360
that's kind of how this works so we on

155
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,560
to the radio and we'll get right out of

156
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,000
there and I trust that cyber knows how

157
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,680
to manage

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,199
that this is not the terminal I'm not

159
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,960
actually surprised by that but might as

160
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,160
well check I mean there is a chance that

161
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,599
is a lock door I'm not even going to

162
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,800
bother trying it I mean I could I just

163
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,120
don't want to I have to Lo thata

164
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,000
anyways I mean there's a camera here too

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,440
but it's a key card so it's going to be

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,800
there isn't it the terminal is literally

167
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,080
going to be there watch we're going to

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,199
have to Loop this camera and it's going

169
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,960
to be annoying so we Loop the camera and

170
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,160
then afterwards we're going to open up

171
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,800
this door I mean there's still one more

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,080
spot it could be and it's downstairs

173
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,639
somewhere

174
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,280
but we'll

175
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,800
see of course it is in front of a camera

176
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,080
to that's literally the worst part which

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,400
I mean I guess it does make no scram

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
look kind of more infuriating I mean

179
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
we've got a key card and we can't even

180
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,319
use it anyways all we got to do now is

181
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,879
get out of there hi that God I mean we

182
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,680
could clear the entire terminal

183
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,720
Commander area of gods but we don't have

184
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,800
to they'll

185
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,800
