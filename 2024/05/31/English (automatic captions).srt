1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,359
all righty today C challenge the cash

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,879
stealth fog hit detection bars and

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,080
reinforc

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,200
cameras so reinforc

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,040
cameras except that we're able to

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,199
literally hack the cameras from outside

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,920
the building with zero repercussions

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,080
whatsoever I guess what I'm trying to

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,560
say is that it's not worth anything at

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,840
all but aside from that we've got

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,240
balancing detection and a lot of fog

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,599
which I mean combined with h and

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
detection bars isn't exactly great but

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,399
it should be fine so cyber's going to go

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,160
over there find a spot and then

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,680
afterwards hack the computer or actually

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,360
the signal RoR so now we just check for

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,520
the power or the switch which I believe

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,640
is over there in the archives a bit hard

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,039
to see but it's barely visible from the

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,440
camera so we'll go all the way over here

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,920
we'll run past we'll run off Sprint and

23
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,359
then afterwards cyber will figure out

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,399
when it's safe because it's fog

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,360
so I suppose what I'm trying to say is

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,439
hopefully I don't run in and encounter a

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,680
lot of

28
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,640
gods but what we need to do is wait for

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,799
these Gods to all leave because of

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,680
course we need to so there's one over

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,400
there another over there kind of

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,119
important to leave them up Conta the

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,680
gods are actually moving especially that

34
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,439
far one which is happening right now and

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,799
now we'll move hopefully no one walks in

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,560
because otherwise this is going to be

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,560
very very awkward we disable it we'll

38
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,320
get out of of there and I believe cyber

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,520
has found a screwdriver stop going into

40
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,520
the

41
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,640
tree right

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,240
then we'll get a

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,439
disguise cyber's just going to stay

44
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,920
there and then we

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,799
will there is no guard over there that

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,240
is not that is literally not helpful to

47
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,360
me I need a guard

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,280
somewhere somewhere I can Le this area

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,680
is practically useless actually hey hold

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,680
on you stay there look at me

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,160
look at me and walk towards

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,720
me I think the God's walking towards me

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,319
let's go over to the door and wait and I

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,520
believe cyber should be up on the tree

55
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,520
by

56
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,200
now I can't even tell at this point nope

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,400
cyber's over there all right then we'll

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,560
wait for the god to move we'll wait for

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,440
him to get off the radio and then we'll

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,080
knock him out but you really got to move

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,280
faster because I did not lure you at a

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,519
convenient spot so we just got to wait I

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,760
mean it's just waiting right now get

64
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,400
over there go backwards hopefully you

65
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,400
get off radio

66
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,800
before I mean a key card's worth

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,360
it I don't like how long it took for why

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,560
cyber I don't like how long it took for

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,519
you to

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,480
actually put your hands up which I mean

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,519
almost went poorly and I'm very happy it

72
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,640
actually went well now cyber really

73
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,920
shooting me from a tree right then we'll

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,080
go around over here we'll go upstairs

75
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,000
and then we'll go figure out what's

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,840
going on now actually we're going to

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,480
leave our scramble outside because we

78
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,120
already have the key card and that's

79
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,680
also so we can actually grab a

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,080
screwdriver so we'll do that real quick

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,840
we'll go back inside we remember that

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,280
we're actually trespassing in there and

83
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,799
now all we got to do is figure out where

84
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,720
the screwdriver is which I mean we found

85
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,000
it earlier but once again it's foggy so

86
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,400
it's not exactly convenient and now

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,120
we'll move right

88
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,280
in and hopefully not get caught which I

89
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,799
mean is probably not going to happen but

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,799
now once we're done with that we will go

91
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,360
upstairs or downstairs for that matter

92
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,480
and figure out where's where we kind of

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,879
need to use Stone close that you know

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,959
what it's fine and it's

95
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,280
downstairs but since there's no one here

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,360
we'll take this opportunity to actually

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,480
lockpick this open because it's going to

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,159
be infuriating when that happens we'll

99
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,920
fit right through there just in time and

100
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,200
go

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,480
downstairs I mean there's not any to

102
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,879
complain about in that case that is

103
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,239
literally perfect so we go do this we'll

104
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,560
walk past all of the Gods and then we'll

105
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,200
use the screwdriver on the panel over

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,680
here cyber stop trying to shoot me just

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,040
don't all

108
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,359
right there we go we'll go upstairs now

109
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,240
run past this C it's going to be fine we

110
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,320
will actually shut that door now go

111
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,360
upstairs run past all of that and cut

112
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,240
the

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,160
wire now hopefully this goes fine

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,039
I'm going to lockpick this because I can

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
really and then afterwards we're going

116
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,280
to help cyber access this area by

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,479
opening up this

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,759
door so that cyber can probably and

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,919
hopefully get one of the Gods so I

120
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,320
actually have a better time down here

121
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,479
but for for now we're just going to go

122
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,720
downstairs and finally open the last

123
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,960
door lots of accessibility highly doubt

124
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
there's actually going to be a god going

125
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,240
downstairs all the way there but if

126
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:04,039
there is might as well use it why not

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,759
and now it's just a waiting game the

128
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,160
gods are going to go reset it at The

129
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,320
Archives and then off those are going to

130
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,680
have to take them out hopefully both in

131
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,240
a basement reload our gun while we can I

132
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
mean we're probably not going to use it

133
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,560
and I really hope we don't need to use

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,759
it but we might need to use

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,840
it now all you need to do is go

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,199
downstairs right that guard's going out

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,199
seemingly so once you're down

138
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,759
here don't walk upstairs

139
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,080
perfect now you put your hands up get

140
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,639
knocked out and I get a free key card

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
and hopefully cyber takes care of that

142
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,919
guard because otherwise I would be

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,880
having a rot of bad time so let's see

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,880
what's going on over

145
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,919
there you pay more attention to don't

146
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,919
walk past

147
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,840
it good now keep your attention on

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,919
me and walk all the way out out here and

149
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,319
cyber you go deal with that

150
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,400
guard you were supposed to go deal with

151
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,400
that guard it's not that

152
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,840
complicated walk out here and we're

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,360
taking out both Gods it's fine actually

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,720
I will not complain about that cyber you

155
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,919
go answer that radio and I will just

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,160
walk through here because it's going to

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,479
go just fine I mean I could have had

158
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,560
another radio to

159
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,240
answer but I

160
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,639
didn't and that's kind of what's

161
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,440
important which means I got to do it

162
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,520
faster we're not I mean we are out of

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,880
take takedowns now but we weren't out of

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,560
takedowns earlier so we should be really

165
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,240
careful not to

166
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,919
get not to run out of them right now or

167
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,080
not to get caught so we don't actually

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,960
have to take on another guard and fail

169
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,039
it so we'll set up this connection it's

170
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,680
going to hopefully go well and then

171
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,520
we're going to go

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,599
upstairs and this part's really

173
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,680
important not get caught because the

174
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,280
guards up there and that luring was

175
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,360
incredibly scuffed but seriously cyber

176
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,360
you really got to go get that now I

177
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,400
presume

178
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,599
that don't complain about it get in here

179
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,599
and

180
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,400
start giving cyber disguise was a bad

181
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,120
idea should have shot both

182
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,919
Gods this was absolutely not worth it

183
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,879
right then we'll take the USB and then

184
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,680
we'll go downstairs and cyber's going to

185
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,400
do their best not to get caught then

186
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,039
will'll go down run past all of those

187
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Gods because it's going to go just

188
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,080
fine and now we'll go inside run past

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,960
that guard because we can not actually

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,599
close the door because it's a bad idea

191
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,479
but also because that's going to go by

192
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,599
real quick or we'll run past all of this

193
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,479
that go over there we'll go through here

194
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:54,120
and then we will shut that door actually

195
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,800
then get right out of there because

196
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:01,759
otherwise it might go pretty poorly so

197
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,759
we run out of here run past all of that

198
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,759
and

199
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,280
cyber right then really shooting me

200
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,560
instead of just getting out of there

201
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,639
interesting choice that's a D cherson in

202
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,090
just under eight minutes cheers everyone

203
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:29,990
have a great time

204
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:29,990
