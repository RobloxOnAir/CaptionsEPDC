1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,120
all right 3 challenge black dust cloud

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,000
arm Arsenal EG Academy and flashbang

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,320
Revenge so we've got a s blade we've got

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,040
an M M20 and we've got a lot of Aegis

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,639
units or in this case juggernauts but

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,320
aside from that we've also got flashbang

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,119
Revenge

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,279
which literally does not mean anything

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,599
at all it is not a threat now we'll

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,880
shoot

11
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,720
those right then thanks now we're going

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,920
to get right over to the defend we help

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,520
of the juggernauts because the

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,520
juggernauts are kind of the main threat

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,680
here but then again there's one good

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,800
thing about the saw blade we can get

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,680
free ammunition from the

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,120
Juggernaut and it has a lot of

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,600
bullets so in other words we have a

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,160
weapon that can for all intents and

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,440
purposes fire infinitely I

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,480
mean we can't actually do that but that

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,199
might as well be the case I mean there

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,479
there is

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,080
literally no reason to fire continuously

26
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,400
indefinitely

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,880
but what we're doing right

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,360
now it's entirely

29
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,320
self-sustainable just because of the

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,759
juggernauts anyways that door should be

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,360
open soon so we're going to help out a

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,000
bit more with getting those shotgunners

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,360
because they will for absolutely no

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,520
reason at all Rush us we'll go through

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,040
via here and then afterwards we'll go

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,759
all the way here to the

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,520
door

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,520
cyber you have the breaching

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,520
charge right then we El un this breach

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,719
over there which we're not going to

41
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,600
worry too much about we'll check for a

42
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,719
screwdriver which is not present and now

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,520
we're just going to watch out for any

44
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,520
units that show

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,360
up that's all of them

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,719
clear I mean

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,960
it's free

48
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,560
ammunition but they're all

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,120
cbc's and while we could use cbrc we're

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,840
not going to do that right

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,080
anyways surely there are some

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,319
juggernauts I want that free ammunition

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
and Med kits but regardless we finished

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,080
blow torching so we're just going to go

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,080
right through here and then

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,800
afterwards s's going to breach into

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
there what I'm going to do is I'm not

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,519
actually going to plant anything there

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,680
because I don't need to I'm going to go

60
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,480
over here and I'm

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,840
actually after a bit of scuff

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,519
reorganizing going to grab myself a

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,159
drill for no real reason

64
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:49,000
actually it's really just

65
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,400
so I have safety in

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,920
case I'll take this

67
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,120
spot right then St I recommend you back

68
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,280
off in that

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,840
situation I'll take those three medits

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,840
that's for sure can I

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,120
can I actually grab those Med

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,720
kits all right squad's not going to

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,720
spawn there which

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,519
is that is a very ambitious whe taking

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,879
care of things we're going to go up here

76
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,440
I'm pretty sure there are units down

77
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,080
there which were just shooting at

78
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,360
me but we're doing fine so I'm sure

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
it'll be

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,280
fine all right no absolutely you are not

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,920
rushing me absolutely no you're not

82
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,080
doing that all right half all of that

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,080
clear and

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,040
then why is there more there's going to

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,040
be more now watch

86
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,799
no that's

87
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,720
predicted well then I mean cyber why are

88
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,799
you still here move just

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:01,439
move it's not that

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:05,640
complicated go over there and go

91
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,480
upstairs it's really not that

92
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,360
complicated and now all we're going to

93
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,879
do is defend for a

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,199
bit cyber you have way too many med kits

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,120
I mean I'll use one of them I don't

96
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,840
mind

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,840
and shotguns are the

98
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,720
worse right then in that case I assume

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,120
you're going to go with me now and

100
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,560
afterwards you

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,160
really take care of both juggernauts let

102
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,000
it breathe for a bit let those

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,440
flashbangs go grab that free ammunition

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,960
that I need that I actually need it

105
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,759
let's go this way let's just go down

106
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,400
over here just so that those juggernauts

107
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,360
won't cause us any it'll be fine let's

108
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,039
just go past all of that and those

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,400
juggernauts will definitely not cause us

110
00:04:53,039 --> 00:05:00,840
any they just reach that door which I

111
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,199
mean sure go off the Cyber for like care

112
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,360
and now we'll go up here and we

113
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,639
will the Juggernaut are coming back over

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,440
here r& D you know what we'll grab that

115
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,039
we'll go over here and we'll use our

116
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,440
drill to get in get into

117
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,280
development and then afterwards we'll

118
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,680
breach that door and we'll plant a few

119
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:26,120
bombs it's really not that

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,120
complicated well you should

121
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,400
probably this is a very questionable

122
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,280
strategy right

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,680
then should I even try and get

124
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,680
that does it

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,639
even there isn't even a breaching charge

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,880
in that back and I am not intending to

127
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,919
go up and try and find out so we're just

128
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,400
going to use our drill over here and

129
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,520
we'll watch out for any units that show

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,280
up and we we will hopefully get through

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,080
this door in a decent amount of time

132
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,960
before any units show

133
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,400
up cyber having a great time over there

134
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,680
I'm certainly having a great time over

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,479
here too anyways we Bri the door we're

136
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,240
going to plant this bomb over here and

137
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,080
we'll plant this bomb over here and hi

138
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,840
there I see

139
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,560
you very

140
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,840
pesy

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,560
right they've still got the bombs on

142
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,560
them

143
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,759
I'm not

144
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,000
surprised I really can't say I am right

145
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,039
then you can drop the drill at least

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,560
that's for sure we can grab that extra

147
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,560
ammunition and now we

148
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,440
can you know my problem with this is the

149
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:53,880
fact that they're all cbc's but that's

150
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,800
besides the point we'll grab all of this

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,360
we will not grab those medits because we

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,800
don't need it but what we will do is

153
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
we'll grab those bombs and we'll try and

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,919
stay aware of whatever's going on over

155
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,800
here because we kind of need to so we'll

156
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,199
go upstairs and we'll plant the Bombs

157
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,280
over here while cyber figures out

158
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,800
whatever's going on over there which I

159
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,520
mean you should probably heal up right

160
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,199
now right around now it would be a

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,520
fantastic time to do

162
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,199
so we'll grab the med kit for no reason

163
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,080
in particular and you know what I mean

164
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,879
it's too late to go back over there

165
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,319
anyways but we could just steal with the

166
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,520
jugg off from over

167
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,879
here who else

168
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,879
prone because pring Thea blade is

169
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,800
actually pretty good for reducing recoil

170
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,400
and spread and we still got a 100

171
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,039
bullets to deal with

172
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,800
it

173
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,639
so I assume this is

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,159
actually all right that was almost much

175
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,599
more High there that was much much more

176
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,560
Awkward than it needed to be if I had to

177
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,720
use my mm20 but as the in just under 7

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,520
minutes and 40 seconds

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,690
people should use slbl more cheers

180
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:26,100
everyone have a great time

181
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:26,100
