really bad aim and I somehow messed it

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,520

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,680
yeah all right getting the

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,840
bags and uh cyber this is not promising

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
yet

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,720

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
now that will not be

52
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,080

yeah

131
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,960
yeah so it's basically going to be about

132
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,080
2023 and um 2024 starting and it's going

133
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,400
to be some really really bad

134
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,039
opinions I mean yeah it has

135
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,120
okay I apologize to the people looking

136
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,080
at this on phone and not reading any of

137
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,560
this but sucks to be you I might read

really quickly 2024 hasn't even started

142
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,319
yet I mean when you watch it probably

143
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,319
will just think it's an Eastern

144
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,400
Standard what you expect was going to

145
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,520
happen Americans are like what 12 hours

146
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,759
